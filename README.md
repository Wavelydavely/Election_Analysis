# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit: 

	Colorado election officials are interested in upgrading their methodology of counting ballots. They currently use Excel to calculate election results, but they are interested in an automated process which could be interchangeably used for elections from the local to federal level. We will begin with a congressional precinct which spans three counties. These are our findings:

  - A total of 369,711 votes were cast. Excel would have told us this just as easily as our code with Python, but we have a much greater degree of flexibility with how we can use a breakdown of these votes.
  - Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct. Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)  
  - Which county had the largest number of votes? Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
  
# Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)

Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)

Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)


# Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)

# Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.

This code is designed to be applicable for the tallying votes of candidates, as well as vote counts for particular regions. We could easily modify the code to incorporate any additional data like precinct and non-identifying voter information. As different electoral systems gain popularity, we could also modify the code to interpret electoral results for systems like ranked-choice voting or approval voting.
