This code is designed to be applicable for the tallying votes of candidates, as well as vote counts for particular regions. We could easily modify the code to incorporate any additional data like precinct and non-identifying voter information. As different electoral systems gain popularity, we could also modify the code to interpret electoral results for systems like ranked-choice voting or approval voting.
